            Market Street Fellowship is a non-denominational Christian church located in
            Wadsworth, Ohio, and committed to a whole-hearted following of Christ in the
            “ancient path” of the daily cross. We believe that the kingdom of God is not
            in traditions and words, but in power; a power (called grace) that overcomes
            sin, self, and the world, and experientially transforms the heart into the
            image and nature of Christ.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-7 text-gray-100 mt-6">
            Our desire is to walk together in His light, life and love, to surrender our
            own will to His in all things, and to grow up together into Him who is the
            Head, even Christ.

                Market Street Fellowship has been so impacted by the writings of the early
                (not modern!) Society of Friends (1650-1800), that we put together a
                website where hundreds of their books are available for free, in a variety
                of different text and audio formats.

                Jared Henderson and Miciah Henderson have spent years building what we
                believe to be the safest parental control software in existence for Apple
                computers. There is also a corresponding Gertrude iPhone app that plugs
                some of the holes that Apple's Screen Time feature misses.
